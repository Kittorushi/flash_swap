# flash_swap
 
Solidity code implements a contract called `UniswapV2FlashSwap` that demonstrates a flash swap functionality using Uniswap V2. Here's an explanation of the code:

- The contract starts with the SPDX-License-Identifier to specify the license under which the code is released.

- The contract includes an interface `IUniswapV2Callee` that defines a function `uniswapV2Call` to handle callback from Uniswap V2.

- The contract defines several private constant addresses:
  - `UNISWAP_V2_FACTORY`: Represents the address of the Uniswap V2 Factory contract.
  - `DAI`: Represents the address of the DAI token.
  - `WETH`: Represents the address of the Wrapped Ether (WETH) token.

- The contract defines constants for the Uniswap V2 Factory contract and the WETH token contract.

- The contract includes a `pair` variable that represents the DAI/WETH pair on Uniswap V2. It is initialized in the constructor by fetching the pair address from the Factory contract.

- The `flashSwap` function enables a flash swap operation. It takes the desired amount of WETH (`wethAmount`) to be borrowed. It encodes the data required for the callback in `data`, which includes the WETH token address and the sender's address. Then, it initiates the swap operation by calling the `swap` function on the DAI/WETH pair, specifying the desired amount of WETH and the contract itself as the recipient.

- The `uniswapV2Call` function is the callback function that is called by the DAI/WETH pair contract after the swap operation. It verifies the caller and the pair address to ensure the security of the contract. It decodes the data passed in and retrieves the borrowed token (WETH) and the caller's address. It performs custom logic, which could include arbitrage or any other desired functionality. In this example, it calculates a fee based on the borrowed amount, transfers the fee from the caller to the contract, and sets the amount to be repaid as `amountToRepay`. Finally, it transfers the amount to be repaid (WETH) to the DAI/WETH pair contract.

- The contract includes interface declarations for the Uniswap V2 Pair, Factory, and ERC20 contracts to interact with the respective contracts.

- There are also events defined for the ERC20 token transfers and approvals.

This contract serves as an example of a flash swap implementation using Uniswap V2. Flash swaps allow users to borrow tokens from a pool and perform arbitrary operations with them within a single transaction, as long as the borrowed tokens are returned by the end of the transaction.
